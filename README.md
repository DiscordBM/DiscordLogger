## Discord Logger
`DiscordLogger` is a [swift-log](https://github.com/apple/swift-log) implementation for sending your logs over to a Discord channel.   
It uses [DiscordBM](https://github.com/DiscordBM/DiscordBM) to communicate with Discord.

## Showcase
You can see Vapor community's Penny bot as a showcase of using this library in production. Penny uses `DiscordLogger` to send a selected group of important logs to an internal channel, so maintainers can be easily notified of any problems that might occur to her.    
Penny is available [here](https://github.com/vapor/penny-bot) and you can see `DiscordLogger` being used [here](https://github.com/vapor/penny-bot/blob/main/CODE/Sources/PennyBOT/Penny.swift) .

## How To Use
  
> Make sure you have **Xcode 14.1 or above**. Lower Xcode 14 versions have known issues that cause problems for libraries.    

Make sure you've added [swift-log](https://github.com/apple/swift-log) and [AsyncHTTPClient](https://github.com/swift-server/async-http-client) to your dependancies.
```swift
import DiscordLogger
import Logging
import AsyncHTTPClient

/// Make an `HTTPClient`.
/// If you've already made an `HTTPClient` somewhere else, you should use that instead.
let httpClient = HTTPClient(eventLoopGroupProvider: .createNew)

/// Configure the Discord Logging Manager.
DiscordGlobalConfiguration.logManager = await DiscordLogManager(
    httpClient: httpClient
)

/// Bootstrap the `LoggingSystem`. After this, all your `Logger`s will automagically start using `DiscordLogHandler`.
/// Do not use a `Task { }` to avoid possible bugs.
/// Wait before the `LoggingSystem` is bootstrapped.  
await LoggingSystem.bootstrapWithDiscordLogger(
    /// The webhook address to send the logs to. 
    /// You can easily create a webhook using Discord desktop app with a few clicks.
    /// See https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks
    /// There is a 'Making A Webhook' there.
    address: try .url(<#Your Webhook URL#>),
    makeMainLogHandler: StreamLogHandler.standardOutput(label:metadataProvider:)
)

/// Make sure you haven't called `LoggingSystem.bootstrap` anywhere else, because you can only call it once.
/// For example Vapor's templates use `LoggingSystem.bootstrap` on boot, and you need to remove that.
```
`DiscordLogManager` comes with a ton of useful configuration options.   
Here is an example of a decently-configured `DiscordLogManager`:   
Read `DiscordLogManager.Configuration.init` documentation for full info.

```swift
DiscordGlobalConfiguration.logManager = await DiscordLogManager(
    httpClient: httpClient,
    configuration: .init(
        aliveNotice: .init(
            address: try .url(<#Your Webhook URL#>),
            /// If nil, DiscordLogger will only send 1 "I'm alive" notice, on boot.
            /// If not nil, it will send a "I'm alive" notice every this-amount too. 
            interval: nil,
            message: "I'm Alive! :)",
            color: .blue,
            initialNoticeMention: .user("970723029262942248")
        ),
        mentions: [
            .warning: .role("970723134149918800"),
            .error: .role("970723101044244510"),
            .critical: .role("970723029262942248"),
        ],
        extraMetadata: [.warning, .error, .critical],
        disabledLogLevels: [.debug, .trace], 
        disabledInDebug: true
    )
)
```

#### Example

```swift
/// After bootstrapping the `LoggingSystem`, and with the configuration above, but `extraMetadata` set to `[.critical]`
let logger = Logger(label: "LoggerLabel")
logger.warning("Warning you about something!")
logger.error("We're having an error!", metadata: [
    "number": .stringConvertible(1),
    "statusCode": "401 Unauthorized"
])
logger.critical("CRITICAL PROBLEM. ABOUT TO EXPLODE ðŸ’¥")
```

## How To Add DiscordLogger To Your Project

To use the `DiscordLogger` library in a SwiftPM project, 
add the following line to the dependencies in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/DiscordBM/DiscordLogger", from: "1.0.0-beta.1"),
```

Include `DiscordLogger` as a dependency for your targets:

```swift
.target(name: "<target>", dependencies: [
    .product(name: "DiscordLogger", package: "DiscordLogger"),
]),
```

Finally, add `import DiscordLogger` to your source code.

## Versioning
`DiscordLogger` will try to follow Semantic Versioning 2.0.0.
